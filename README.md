# num-counter-js

Based on the project with the same name from freeCodeCamp's "[Build 15 JavaScript Projects - Vanilla JavaScript Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4)" video on YouTube.

Rather than following the tutorial, I instead recreated the layout and programmed the functionality based on the inital demostration of how the page should look and how the program should work when finished.
